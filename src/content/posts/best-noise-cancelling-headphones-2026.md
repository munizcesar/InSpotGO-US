# Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones: Technical Evaluation

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology has matured significantly with manufacturers implementing AI-powered adaptive algorithms, enhanced microphone arrays, and improved codec support. This analysis evaluates leading models based on ANC performance, audio quality, comfort, and feature sets.

## Testing Methodology

**ANC Performance Measurement:**
- Decibel reduction at various frequencies (50Hz-8kHz)
- Tested in airplane cabin (~75-85dB), coffee shop (~65-70dB), office (~55-60dB)
- Pink noise, white noise, and real-world environment testing

**Audio Quality Assessment:**
- Frequency response measurement (20Hz-20kHz)
- Codec support evaluation (SBC, AAC, LDAC, aptX Adaptive)
- A/B testing with reference tracks
