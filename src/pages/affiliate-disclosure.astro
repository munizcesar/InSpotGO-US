      <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, the company pays us a commission. 
        This commission varies by product and program, but typically ranges from 1% to 30% of the 
        purchase price, depending on the category and specific agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> You never pay more by using our affiliate links. In many cases, 
        we're able to negotiate exclusive discounts or bonuses for our readers.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        While we earn commissions from affiliate links, our affiliate relationships do not influence 
        our editorial decisions. Here's our commitment to you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We provide unbiased reviews based on research, testing, 
          and analysis. We highlight both pros and cons of every product.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Pay-to-Play:</strong> Companies cannot pay for positive reviews or higher 
          rankings on our site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User-First Recommendations:</strong> We only recommend products we believe 
          genuinely benefit our readers, regardless of commission rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparent Updates:</strong> We regularly update our reviews to reflect new 
          information, price changes, and better alternatives when they emerge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear Identification:</strong> We clearly mark affiliate links and include 
          disclosures on pages containing affiliate content.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Sponsored Content</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, we may publish sponsored content where companies pay us to create content 
        about their products. All sponsored content is clearly labeled as "Sponsored," "Advertisement," 
        or "Paid Partnership" at the beginning of the article.

        products we believe could genuinely benefit our audience.

    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Product Testing and Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        When possible, we test products ourselves before reviewing them. In cases where we haven't 
        personally tested a product, we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct thorough research from multiple credible sources</li>
        <li>Analyze user reviews and feedback from verified purchasers</li>
        <li>Compare specifications and features against competitors</li>
        <li>Clearly state in our review that we haven't personally tested the product</li>
      </ul>
