## 🎨 Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Core Writing Style: Professional, Journalistic, Tech-Style

InSpotGO follows the editorial standards of leading tech publications like **TechCrunch**, **The Verge**, and **Wirecutter**.

#### ✅ DO Write Like This:

**Professional Tone:**
- Clear, authoritative, and credible
- Fact-based with data and sources
- Objective analysis with expert insights
- Structured like tech journalism, not blog posts

**Tech-Style Language:**
- Use industry-standard terminology correctly
- Explain technical concepts clearly without dumbing down
- Reference specs, benchmarks, and real-world tests
- Compare objectively using measurable criteria

**Journalistic Approach:**
- Start with the most important information (inverted pyramid)
- Support claims with evidence and testing
- Include multiple perspectives when relevant
- Update content with "Editor's Note" when facts change
- Cite sources and link to official specifications

#### ❌ DON'T Write Like This:

**Avoid Casual/Informal:**
- ❌ "What's Hot" → ✅ "Trending Now"
- ❌ "Check this out!" → ✅ "Notable features include"
- ❌ "Super cool gadget" → ✅ "Innovative device"
- ❌ "This thing is awesome!" → ✅ "This product performs exceptionally well"

**Avoid Overhype:**
- ❌ "Mind-blowing performance!"
- ❌ "You won't believe this!"
- ❌ "The absolute best ever!"
- ❌ Excessive exclamation marks!!!

**Avoid Marketing Speak:**
- ❌ "Revolutionary game-changer"
- ❌ "Must-have product"
- ❌ "Life-changing experience"
- ❌ Buzzwords without substance

### Vocabulary Guidelines

**Tech Terminology Standards:**

- Specify measurements: "8GB RAM" not "lots of memory"
- Reference benchmarks: "scored 1,200 on Geekbench" not "runs fast"
- Include model numbers: "iPhone 16 Pro" not "latest iPhone"

### Writing Structure (Journalistic)

## ✍️ Writing Process

### Step 1: Research & Planning

#### A. Keyword Research
1. Use Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush
2. Find keywords with:
   - Monthly search volume: 500-5,000 (sweet spot for starting)
   - Low-medium competition
   - Buyer intent ("best", "review", "vs", "comparison")

**Professional keyword examples**:
- "best noise cancelling headphones professional use"
- "notion vs clickup feature comparison"
- "how to select laptop for video production"

#### B. Competitor Analysis
1. Google your target keyword
2. Analyze top 5 results:
   - Editorial structure and depth
   - Technical details included
   - Testing methodology
   - What authoritative sources they cite
   - Gaps in coverage you can fill

#### C. Outline Creation
1. Create detailed outline with journalistic structure
2. Plan data points and benchmarks to include
3. Identify technical specifications needed
4. Note expert sources to cite
5. Map affiliate link placements (naturally integrated)

### Step 2: Content Creation

#### Writing Guidelines:

**Tone & Voice**:
- ✅ Professional and authoritative
- ✅ Objective with clear methodology
- ✅ Technical but accessible
- ✅ Evidence-based conclusions
- ✅ Use active voice: "We tested" not "Tests were conducted"
- ✅ Present tense for current products
- ✅ Precise language over vague descriptors

**Structure**:
- Lead with most important information
- Use descriptive, specific H2/H3 headings
- Include data tables for specifications
- Add benchmark results where applicable
- Use bold for technical terms on first use
- Include editor's notes for updates

**Word Count Guidelines**:
- Product Review: 1,800-2,800 words
- Comparison Analysis: 2,200-3,500 words
- Buying Guide: 2,800-4,500 words
- Technical Guide: 1,500-2,500 words

**SEO Optimization** (Natural Integration):
- Include target keyword in:
  - Title (H1) - naturally phrased
  - First paragraph (lede)
  - At least one H2 (contextually)
  - Meta description
  - URL slug
  - Image alt text (descriptively)
- Write for readers first, search engines second
- Use semantic keywords and industry terminology
- Link to authoritative sources (manufacturers, spec sheets)
- Internal linking to related content

**Professional Language Examples:**

❌ **Avoid:**
> "This laptop is super fast and has tons of RAM! You'll love how quick it runs your apps."

✅ **Write Instead:**
> "The device features 16GB of DDR5 RAM and an Intel Core i7-13700H processor, delivering benchmark scores of 1,850 in Geekbench 6 single-core and 12,400 in multi-core tests—performance sufficient for professional video editing and 3D rendering workflows."

### Step 3: Adding Affiliate Links (Professional Integration)

#### Where to Place Links:
1. **Summary section** - "Check current pricing"
2. **Product comparison tables** - Linked product names
3. **Within analysis** - Natural contextual mentions
4. **Alternatives section** - "View specifications"
5. **Conclusion** - "See latest offers"

#### Professional CTA Examples:

❌ **Avoid:**
> "BUY NOW!!! 🔥 CLICK HERE FOR AMAZING DEALS!!!"

✅ **Use Instead:**
```astro
<a href="{affiliateLink}" 
   class="btn-primary"
   target="_blank"
   rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">
  View Current Pricing →
</a>

<!-- Or -->
<a href="{link}" rel="nofollow sponsored">
  Check Specifications
</a>
```

**Place at top of every review/comparison:**
